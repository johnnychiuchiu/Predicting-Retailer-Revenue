A Kaggle InClass Prediction Competition to predict the customer spending in response to an email offer from a German retailer

## Problem Description
On Aug 1, 2014 a leading German book retailer sent out an offer to its customers. They observed the purchases that were made in response to this offer. Our task is to use information that was available to the company as of Aug 1, 2014 to construct a machine learning model that predicts the spending in response to the offer.
